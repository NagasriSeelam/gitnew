Task 1: Predict Restaurant Ratin

  • Objective: To Build a machine learning model to predict the aggregate rating of a restaurant based on 
  other features.

  • Steps:

    ° Preprocessed the dataset by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and splitting
    the data into training and testing sets.

    ° Selected a regression algorithm (e.g., linear regression, decision tree regression) and train it on
    the training data.

    ° Evaluated the model's performance using appropriate regression metrics (e.g., mean squared error, 
    R-squared) on the testing data.

    ° Interpreted the model's results and analyze the most influential features affecting restaurant 
    ratings.

Task 2: Restaurant Recommendation

  • Objective: To Create a restaurant recommendation system based on user preferences.

  • Steps:
  
    ° Preprocessed the dataset by handling missing. values and encoding categorical variables.
    
    ° Determined the criteria for restaurant recommendations (e.g., cuisine preference, price range).

    ° Implemented a content-based filtering approach where users are recommended restaurants similar to 
    their preferred criteria.

    ° Tested the recommendation system by providing sample user preferences and evaluating the quality of 
    recommendations.

Task 3: 

  • Objective: Develop a machine learning model to classify restaurants based on their cuisines.

  • Steps:
  
    ° Preprocess the dataset by handling missing value and encoding categorical variables.

    ° Split the data into training and testing sets.

    ° Select a classification algorithm (e.g., logistic regression, random forest) and train it on the
    training data.

    ° Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate classification metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision,
    recall) on the testing data.
    
    ° Analyze the model's performance across different cuisines and identify any challenges or biases.
